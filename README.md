## Specification Checklist
- [DONE] 1-4 bars can be configured via code

- [WIP] A read-only mode should be able to be set

- [DONE] The Y-axis maximum can be set on initialisation and can be dynamically changed after rendering.

- [DONE] The Y-axis should not be able to be set lower than the histogram columns

- [DONE] The page should be able to have multiple components at a time  

## Requirements
- [**OK**] No 3rd party charting or drag-and-drop libraries - we are testing your ability to create complex UIs and interactions

- [**OK**] As we use React.js for our application development, please only use `react` and `react-dom` as the view library.

- [**OK**] You are allowed to use js utilities libraries: `lodash`, `ramda`, `jquery`, etc

- [**OK**] **No libraries used in creating this test**. Please limit your use of 3rd party libraries - exercise your judgement but we want to see how you approach creating this component 

- [**OK**] Please add to your README, why you choose to use a particular library/utility

- Feel free to use TypeScript/Flow if that's what you prefer; untyped JavaScript is perfectly fine too.
